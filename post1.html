        <h1>Getting Back on the HTML Horse</h1>
        <h3>July 29, 2023</h3>
        <p>It’s time for me to get back into learning web development. I created my first web page a year ago. It was a landing page for OnlyPaws, a social media site for dogs. I followed along with the Odin Project, an amazing free resource for learning web development. After completing the foundations part of the course I lost interest while working on their Ruby on Rails section. The course kept going over programming concepts that I already knew. I couldn’t stay motivated to follow the course, feeling like I needed even more control over my learning.
            It was this year I discovered I enjoyed self learning. I managed to teach myself C# programming using a combination of books, videos and projects. The last few months I have been using Chat GPT to learn C# scripting with Unity. Whenever I ran into a concept I didn't know I would ask GPT to explain it. I could ask any follow up question, and use any language I wanted without judgement. This self learning style was amazing for me.
            Now, i've decided to apply this self learning style to full stack web development. With the help of GPT I developed a curriculum. We decided on concepts to learn, books to read, and projects to build for each week of the curriculum. The project for the first couple of weeks is to build a blog and slowly add functionality to it. I plan to use this blog to share my progress and challenges as they come up. Using large language models to learn new technologies is still a novel concept, and hopefully I can help anyone with a similar interest in self learning.
